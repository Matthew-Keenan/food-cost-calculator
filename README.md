# food-cost-calculator

Program is used to divide delivery fees more fairly on group orders. Data such as number of people ordering food, number of items per person, cost per food item, deivery fee, tax,
and tip are inputted by the user, and the program returns how much each person owes of the total order.

The program calculates how much each person owes by determining what percent of just the food cost was for thier food, then multiplies the that percentage by the sum of the tax
and fees. 

This ensures that if someone orders a lot of food, they are responsible for more of the tax and fees, since more of the order total is for them.

Ex. Two people order food, 90% of the food cost is for one person's order, the other 10% of the food cost is the second person's food order. Since person one is responsible for 90%
of the food total, they pay 90% of the fees and tax.
